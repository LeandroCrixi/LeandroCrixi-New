Project Bootstrap Script for Website Starter

Please set up a basic HTML5 website project with the following structure and conventions:

1. Create an index.html file with a valid HTML5 boilerplate. Link only src/css/style.css in the <head>, and src/js/script.js before the closing </body>.
2. Inside a src folder, create:
    - css folder with:
        - style.css (main stylesheet, imports all other CSS)
        - utils folder for utility/global styles:
            - global.css (CSS reset)
            - typography.css (typography utilities)
            - colors.css (color variables/utilities)
        - components folder for section/component styles:
            - header.css
            - footer.css
    - js folder with:
        - script.js (main JavaScript file)
3. In style.css, import all utility and component CSS files using @import.
4. Do not link any CSS file except style.css in index.html.
5. Use best practices for folder naming and modular CSS organization.
